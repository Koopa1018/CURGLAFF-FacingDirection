# CURGLAFF-FacingDirection
**THIS PACKAGE IS DEPRECATED. Please use the fork found in the [CURGLAFF Foundational Packages Repository](https://github.com/Koopa1018/CURGLAFF-BasePackages).**

Simple data components for Unity which store and represent a direction an object is facing.

Variants are available both for systems which do and for systems which do not need to know when objects are facing upwards.
Additionally, an integer-based variant is provided for systems that only care *whether* an object is facing up/down and left/right, not *how much* of each axis is being used.

This system is currently MonoBehaviour-only. For my needs, ECS compatibility is not planned for the near future, but if anyone needs, I can get on that.
